      "desc": "<p><b>Ice cream</b> (derived from earlier <b>iced cream</b> or <b>cream ice</b>) is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavours. It is typically sweetened with sucrose, corn syrup, cane sugar, beet sugar, and/or other sweeteners. Typically, flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (&lt;35 °F / 2 °C). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>\n<p>The meaning of the phrase \"ice cream\" varies from one country to another. Phrases such as \"frozen custard\", \"frozen yogurt\", \"sorbet\", \"gelato\" and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, such as the United States, the phrase \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are labelled \"frozen dairy dessert\" instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.</p>\n<p>Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or in cones, which are licked. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie. Ice cream is used to prepare other desserts, including ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes and even baked items, such as the Baked Alaska."

      "desc": "<p>A <b>taco</b> is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety. A taco is generally eaten without utensils and is often accompanied by garnishes such as salsa or chili pepper, avocado or guacamole, cilantro (coriander), tomatoes, onions and lettuce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are theoretical. According to the Real Academia Española, publisher of <i>Diccionario de la Lengua Española</i>, the word <i>taco</i> describes a typical Mexican dish of a maize tortilla folded around food (\"Tortilla de maíz enrollada con algún alimento dentro, típica de México\"). This meaning of the Spanish word \"taco\" is a Mexican innovation, but in other dialects \"taco\" is used to mean \"wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; short, thick piece of wood.\" As used in this non-culinary way, the word \"taco\" has cognates in other European languages, including the French word \"tache\" and the English word \"tack (nail).\"</p>\n<p>According to one etymological theory, the culinary meaning of \"taco\" derives from its \"plug\" meaning as employed among Mexican silver miners, who used explosive charges in plug form consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling. However, indigenous origins for the culinary word \"taco\" are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word \"tlahco\", meaning \"half\" or \"in the middle,\" in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla. Also, the Náhuatl word for the corn tortilla (an indigenous Pre-Columbian invention) is \"tlaxcalli\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<p>The taco predates the arrival of Europeans in Mexico. There is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which Hernán Cortés arranged for his captains in Coyoacán. If one accepts the theory that the culinary word \"taco\" derives from its non-culinary usage in Continental Spanish as opposed to indigenous etymological theories, it is not clear why the Spanish would have used a word in their own language to describe this indigenous food.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Traditional_tacos\">Traditional tacos</span></h2>\n<p>There are many traditional varieties of tacos:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Tacos Al pastor</b>/<b>De Adobada</b> (\"shepherd style\") are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.</li>\n<li><b>Tacos de Asador</b> (\"spit\" or \"grill\" tacos) may be composed of any of the following: <i>carne asada tacos</i>; <i><b>tacos de tripita</b></i> (\"tripe tacos\"), grilled until crisp; and, <i>chorizo asado</i> (traditional Spanish style sausage). Each type is served on two overlapped small tortillas and sometimes garnished with guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro (coriander). Also prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called <i>mulita</i> (\"little mule\") made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with Oaxaca style cheese. <i>\"Mulita\"</i> is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico, while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas. Tacos may also be served with salsa.</li>\n<li><b>Tacos de Cabeza</b> or head tacos, in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow. These include: <i>Cabeza</i>, a serving of the muscles of the head; <i>Sesos</i> (\"brains\"); <i>Lengua</i> (\"tongue\"); <i>Cachete</i> (\"cheeks\"); <i>Trompa</i> (\"lips\"); and, <i>Ojo</i> (\"eye\"). Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency. These tacos are typically served in pairs, and also include salsa, onion and cilantro (coriander) with occasional use of guacamole.</li>\n<li><b>Tacos de camarones</b> (\"<b>shrimp tacos</b>\") also originated in Baja California in Mexico. Grilled or fried shrimp are used, usually with the same accompaniments as fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.</li>\n<li><b>Tacos de Cazo</b> for which a metal bowl filled with lard is typically used as a deep-fryer. Meats for these types of tacos typically include: <i>Tripa</i> (\"tripe\", usually from a pig instead of a cow); <i>Suadero</i> (tender beef cuts), <i>Carnitas</i> and <i>Buche</i> (Literally, <i>\"crop\"</i>, as in <i>bird's crop</i>; here, it is fried pig's esophagus.)</li>\n<li><b>Tacos de lengua</b>, beef tongue tacos. Cooked in water with onions, garlic, and bay leaves for several hours until tender and soft, then sliced and sautéed in a small amount of oil. \"It is said that unless a taqueria offers tacos de lengua, it is not a real taqueria.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li><b>Tacos de pescado</b> (\"<b>fish tacos</b>\") originated in Baja California in Mexico, where they consist of grilled or fried fish, lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. In the United States, they were first popularized by the Rubio's fast-food chain, and remain most popular in California, Colorado, and Washington. In California, they are often found at street vendors, and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top.</li>\n<li><b>Tacos dorados</b> (fried tacos, literally, \"golden tacos\") called <b><i>flauta</i>s</b> (\"flute\", because of the shape), or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or <i>barbacoa</i>, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. They are sometimes cooked in a microwave oven or broiled.</li>\n<li><b>Tacos sudados</b> (\"<b>sweaty tacos</b>\") are made by filling soft tortillas with a spicy meat mixture, then placing them in a basket covered with cloth. The covering keeps the tacos warm and traps steam (\"sweat\") which softens them.</li>\n</ul><p>As an accompaniment to tacos, many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes, lime slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally cucumber slices, or grilled cambray onions.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional center\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 255px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 255px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 255px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 255px\">\n\n</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Non-traditional_variations\">Non-traditional variations</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Hard-shell_tacos\">Hard-shell tacos</span></h3>\n<p>Beginning from the early part of the twentieth century, various styles of tacos have become popular in the United States and Canada. An early appearance of a description of the taco in the United States in English was in a 1914 cookbook, <i>California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook</i>, by Bertha Haffner Ginger. The style that has become most common is the hard-shell, U-shaped version described in a cookbook, <i>The good life: New Mexican food</i>, authored by Fabiola Cabeza de Vaca Gilbert and published in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1949. These have been sold by restaurants and by fast food chains. Even non-Mexican oriented fast food restaurants have sold tacos. Mass production of this type of taco was encouraged by the invention of devices to hold the tortillas in the U-shape as they were deep-fried. A patent for such a device was issued to New York restaurateur Juvenico Maldonado in 1950, based on his patent filing of 1947 (U.S. Patent No. 2,506,305). Such tacos are crisp-fried corn tortillas filled with seasoned ground beef, cheese, lettuce, and sometimes tomato, onion, salsa, sour cream, and avocado or guacamole.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Soft-shell_tacos\">Soft-shell tacos</span></h3>\n<p>Traditionally, soft-shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco - usually by grilling or steaming. More recently the term has come to include flour tortilla based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains. In this context, <i>soft tacos</i> are tacos made with wheat flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Crispy_tacos\">Crispy tacos</span></h3>\n\n<p>A mostly California variation where the (sometimes over-sized) corn tortilla is fried or deep-fried in oil (originally, lard). The meat can be anything, such as ground beef, beef tip, \"asada\" (marinated skirt or flank steak), shredded beef, chicken or pork (carnitas). Ground beef is generally diluted with refried bean paste and/or potato, and heavily seasoned. The meat is generally topped with jack and/or cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato (and sometimes avocado and/or sour cream), with salsa on top.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Puffy_tacos.2C_taco_kits.2C_tacodillas_and_breakfast_tacos\">Puffy tacos, taco kits, tacodillas and breakfast tacos</span></h3>\n<p>Since at least 1978, a variation called the \"<b>puffy taco</b>\" has been popular. <i>Henry's Puffy Tacos</i>, opened by Henry Lopez in San Antonio, Texas, claims to have invented the variation, in which uncooked corn tortillas (flattened balls of masa dough) are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become \"puffy\". Fillings are similar to hard-shell versions. Restaurants offering this style of taco have since appeared in other Texas cities, as well as in California, where Henry's brother, Arturo Lopez, opened <i>Arturo's Puffy Taco</i> in Whittier, not long after Henry's opened. Henry's continues to thrive, managed by the family's second generation.</p>\n<p>Kits are available at grocery and convenience stores and usually consist of taco shells (corn tortillas already fried in a U-shape), seasoning mix and taco sauce. Commercial vendors for the home market also market soft taco kits with tortillas instead of taco shells.</p>\n<p>The tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas, thus resembling a quesadilla.</p>\n<p>The breakfast taco, found in at least Tex-Mex cuisine, is a soft corn or flour tortilla filled with meat, eggs, or cheese, with other ingredients. Some have claimed that Austin, Texas is the home of the breakfast taco. However, food writer and OC Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano responded that such a statement reflects a common trend of \"whitewashed\" foodways reporting, noting that predominantly Hispanic San Antonio, Texas \"never had to brag about its breakfast taco love—folks there just call it 'breakfast.'\"</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Indian_tacos\">Indian tacos</span></h3>\n<p>Indian tacos, or <i>Navajo tacos</i>, are made using frybread instead of tortillas. They are commonly eaten at pow-wows, festivals, and other gatherings by and for indigenous people in the United States and Canada.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional center\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 255px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 255px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 255px\">\n\n</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation book\">Arellano, Gustavo (2012). <i>Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America</i>.

      "desc": "<p>A <b>hot dog</b> (also spelled <b>hotdog</b>) is a cooked sausage, traditionally grilled or steamed and served in a sliced bun as a sandwich. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in blankets. Typical hot dog garnishes include mustard, ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, relish, cheese, chili, olives, and sauerkraut.</p>\n<p>The sausages were culturally imported from Germany and popularized in the United States, where they were a working class street food sold at hot dog stands that came to be associated with baseball and America. Hot dog preparation and condiment styles also vary regionally across the United States. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and Wienermobile.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n<p>Claims about hot dog invention are difficult to assess, as stories assert the creation of the sausage, the placing of the sausage (or another kind of sausage) on bread or a bun as finger food, the popularization of the existing dish, or the application of the name \"hot dog\" to a sausage and bun combination most commonly used with ketchup or mustard and sometimes relish.</p>\n<p>The word <b>frankfurter</b> comes from Frankfurt, Germany, where pork sausages similar to hot dogs originated. These sausages, <i>Frankfurter Würstchen</i>, were known since the 13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting with the coronation of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor as King. <b>Wiener</b> refers to Vienna, Austria, whose German name is \"Wien\", home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and beef (cf. Hamburger, whose name also derives from a German-speaking city). Johann Georg Lahner, an 18th/19th century butcher from the Franconian city of Coburg, is said to have brought the <i>Frankfurter Würstchen</i> to Vienna, where he added beef to the mixture and simply called it <i>Frankfurter</i>. Nowadays, in German speaking countries, except Austria, hot dog sausages are called <i>Wiener</i> or <i>Wiener Würstchen</i> (<i>Würstchen</i> means \"little sausage\"), in differentiation to the original pork only mixture from Frankfurt. In Swiss German, it is called <i>Wienerli</i>, while in Austria the terms <i>Frankfurter</i> or <i>Frankfurter Würstel</i> are used.</p>\n<p>Around 1870, on Coney Island, German immigrant Charles Feltman began selling sausages in rolls.</p>\n\n<p>Others are credited with first serving hot dogs on rolls. A Bavarian immigrant named Feuchtwanger allegedly pioneered the practice in the American midwest; there are several versions of the story with varying details. According to one account, Antonoine Feuchtwanger's wife proposed the use of a bun in 1880: Feuchtwanger sold hot dogs on the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, United States, and provided gloves to his customers so that they could handle the sausages without burning their hands. Losing money when customers did not return the gloves, Feuchtwanger's wife suggested serving the food in a roll instead. In another version, Anton Ludwig Feuchtwanger served sausages in rolls at the World's Fair–either the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago or the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis–again allegedly because the white gloves provided to customers to protect their hands were being kept as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>The association between hot dogs and baseball began as early as 1893 with Chris von der Ahe, a German immigrant who owned not only the St. Louis Browns, but also an amusement park.</p>\n<p>Another claim of inventing the hot dog is told by Harry M. Stevens, an American sports concessionaire whose vendors sold German sausages and rolls to spectators at the old New York Polo Grounds during the winter. He called them \"Dachshund sandwiches\", but a New York Post cartoonist \"couldn't spell dachshund, so when he drew the cartoon, he called them hot dogs.\"</p>\n<p>In 1916, a Polish American employee of Feltman's named Nathan Handwerker was encouraged by Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante, both working as waiters/musicians, to go into business in competition with his former employer. Handwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging ten.</p>\n<p>At an earlier time in food regulation, when the hot dog was suspect, Handwerker made sure that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at Nathan's Famous to reassure potential customers.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The term <i>dog</i> has been used as a synonym for sausage since 1884 and accusations that sausage makers used dog meat date to at least 1845. In the early 20th century, consumption of dog meat in Germany was common. The suspicion that sausages contained dog meat was \"occasionally justified\".</p>\n<p>According to a myth, the use of the complete phrase <i>hot dog</i> in reference to sausage was coined by the newspaper cartoonist Thomas Aloysius \"TAD\" Dorgan around 1900 in a cartoon recording the sale of hot dogs during a New York Giants baseball game at the Polo Grounds. However, TAD's earliest usage of <i>hot dog</i> was not in reference to a baseball game at the Polo Grounds, but to a bicycle race at Madison Square Garden, in <i>The New York Evening Journal</i> December 12, 1906, by which time the term <i>hot dog</i> in reference to sausage was already in use. In addition, no copy of the apocryphal cartoon has ever been found.</p>\n<p>Early uses of <i>hot dog</i> in reference to sausage appeared in the <i>New Brunswick</i> (New Jersey) <i>Daily Times</i> (May 20, 1893), the <i>New York World</i> (May 26, 1893), and the <i>Knoxville</i> (Tennessee) <i>Journal</i> (September 28, 1893).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"General_description\">General description</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Ingredients\">Ingredients</span></h3>\n<p>Common hot dog ingredients include:</p>\n<ul><li>Meat trimmings and fat</li>\n<li>Flavorings, such as salt, garlic, and paprika</li>\n<li>Preservatives (cure) – typically sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite</li>\n</ul><p>Pork and beef are the traditional meats used in hot dogs. Less expensive hot dogs are often made from chicken or turkey, using low-cost mechanically separated poultry. Hot dogs often have high sodium, fat and nitrite content, ingredients linked to health problems. Changes in meat technology and dietary preferences have led manufacturers to use turkey, chicken, vegetarian meat substitutes, and to lower the salt content.</p>\n<p>If a manufacturer produces two types of hot dogs, \"wieners\" tend to contain pork and are blander, while \"franks\" tend to be all beef and more strongly seasoned.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Commercial_preparation\">Commercial preparation</span></h3>\n\n<p>Hot dogs are prepared commercially by mixing the ingredients (meats, spices, binders and fillers) in vats where rapidly moving blades grind and mix the ingredients in the same operation. This mixture is forced through tubes into casings for cooking. Most hot dogs sold in the US are \"skinless\" as opposed to more expensive \"natural casing\" hot dogs.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Natural_casing_hot_dogs\">Natural casing hot dogs</span></h4>\n<p>As with most sausages, hot dogs must be in a casing to be cooked. Traditional casing is made from the small intestines of sheep. The products are known as \"natural casing\" hot dogs or frankfurters. These hot dogs have firmer texture and a \"snap\" that releases juices and flavor when the product is bitten.</p>\n<p>Kosher casings are expensive in commercial quantities in the US, so kosher hot dogs are usually skinless or made with reconstituted collagen casings.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Skinless_hot_dogs\">Skinless hot dogs</span></h4>\n<p>\"Skinless\" hot dogs must use a casing in the cooking process when the product is manufactured, but the casing is usually a long tube of thin cellulose that is removed between cooking and packaging. This process was invented in Chicago in 1925 by Erwin O. Freund, founder of Visking which would later become Viskase Companies.</p>\n<p>The first skinless hot dog casings were produced by Freund's new company under the name \"Nojax\", short for \"no jackets\" and sold to local Chicago sausage makers.</p>\n<p>Skinless hot dogs vary in the texture of the product surface but have a softer \"bite\" than natural casing hot dogs. Skinless hot dogs are more uniform in shape and size than natural casing hot dogs and less expensive.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Home_cooking_hot_dogs\">Home cooking hot dogs</span></h3>\n<p>Hot dogs are prepared and eaten in a variety of ways. The wieners may be boiled, grilled, fried, steamed, broiled, baked, or microwaved. The cooked wiener may be served on a bun (usually topped with condiments), or it may be used as an ingredient in another dish. Various models of hot dog toasters exist that cook the hot dog and buns by toasting.</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional center\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 190px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 190px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 190px\">\n\n</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Health_effects\">Health effects</span></h2>\n\n<p>Unlike other sausages which may be sold uncooked, hot dogs are cooked before packaging. Hot dogs can be eaten without additional cooking, although they are usually warmed before serving. An unopened package of hot dogs contains ingredients that have the potential for promoting the growth of <i>Listeria</i> bacteria. <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> can also cause serious infections in infants and pregnant women, and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. Adults with suppressed immune systems can also be negatively affected. <i>Listeria</i> infections have the potential to seriously harm or even cause the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system deficiency or a congenital defect of the immune system.The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms of a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other animal products such as unpasteurized milk, delicatessen meats, and cheese. Prevention involves heating the hot dogs to a temperature that will kill pathogens.</p>\n<p>An American Institute for Cancer Research report found that consuming one 50-gram serving of processed meat — about one hot dog — every day increases risk of colorectal cancer by 20 percent. The Cancer Project group filed a class-action lawsuit demanding warning labels on packages and at sporting events. Hot dogs are high in fat and salt and have preservatives sodium nitrate and nitrite, which are possible contributors to nitrate-containing chemicals believed to cause cancer. According to the AICR, the average risk of colorectal cancer is 5.8 percent, but 7 percent when a hot dog is consumed daily over years.</p>\n<p>Hot dogs have relatively low heterocyclic amines (HCA) levels compared to other types of ready-to-eat meat products, because they are manufactured at low temperatures.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Choking_risk\">Choking risk</span></h3>\n<p>Hot dogs present a significant choking risk, especially for children. A study in the US found that 17% of food-related asphyxiations among children younger than 10 years of age were caused by hot dogs. Their size, shape and texture make them difficult to expel from the windpipe. This risk can be reduced by cutting a hot dog into small pieces or lengthwise strips before serving to young children. It is suggested that redesign of size, shape and texture would reduce the risk.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_the_United_States\">In the United States</span></h2>\n\n<p>In the US, \"hot dog\" may refer to just the sausage or to the combination of a sausage in a bun. Many nicknames for hot dogs have popped up over the years. A hot dog can often be seen under the names of frankfurter, frank, red hot, wiener, weenie, durger, coney, or just \"dog\".</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hot_dog_restaurants\">Hot dog restaurants</span></h3>\n<p>Hot dog stands and trucks sell hot dogs at street and highway locations. Wandering hot dog vendors sell their product in baseball parks. At convenience stores, hot dogs are kept heated on rotating grills. 7-Eleven sells the most grilled hot dogs in North America — 100 million annually. Hot dogs are also common on restaurants' children's menus.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Condiments\">Condiments</span></h3>\n\n<p>Hot dogs may be served plain, but are commonly served with a variety of condiments, including ketchup, mustard, chile con carne, pickle relish, sauerkraut, onion, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and chili peppers.</p>\n<p>In 2005, the US-based National Hot Dog &amp; Sausage Council (part of the American Meat Institute) found mustard to be the most popular condiment, with 32% of respondents preferring it; 23% of Americans said they preferred ketchup; chili con carne came in third at 17%, followed by relish at 9% and onions at 7%. Southerners showed the strongest preference for chili, while Midwesterners showed the greatest affinity for ketchup.</p>\n<p>Condiments vary across the country. All-beef Chicago-style hot dogs are served in a poppyseed bun and topped with mustard, fresh tomatoes, onions, sport peppers, bright green relish, dill pickles, and celery salt, but they exclude ketchup.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Variations\">Variations</span></h3>\n\n<p>Many variations are named after regions other than the one in which they are popular. Italian hot dogs popular in New Jersey include peppers, onions, and potatoes. Meaty Michigan hot dogs are popular in upstate New York (as are white hots), while beefy Coney Island hot dogs are popular in Michigan. In New York City, conventional hot dogs are available on Coney Island, as are bagel dogs. Hot wieners, or weenies, are a staple in Rhode Island where they are sold at restaurants with the misleading name \"New York System.\" Texas hot dogs are spicy variants found in upstate New York and Pennsylvania (and as \"all the way dogs\" in New Jersey), but not Texas.</p>\n<p>Some baseball parks have signature hot dogs, such as Fenway Franks at Fenway Park in Boston and Dodger Dogs at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. The Fenway signature is that the hot dog is boiled and grilled, and then served on a New England-style bun, covered with ketchup and relish. Often during Red Sox games, vendors traverse the stadium selling the hot dogs plain, giving customers the choice of adding the condiments.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_Canada\">In Canada</span></h2>\n<p>Skinner's Restaurant, in Lockport, Manitoba is reputed to be Canada's oldest hot dog outlet in continuous operation, founded in 1929, by Jim Skinner Sr. Hotdogs served at Skinners are European style footlongs with natural casings, manufactured by Winnipeg Old Country Sausage in Winnipeg, Manitoba.</p>\n<p>The Half Moon Drive In, also in Lockport, Manitoba and located directly across the river from Skinners, was established in 1938 by brothers Peter and Louie Kosowicz. The original drive in consisted of three wooden buildings shaped like semicircles—one was for takeout, one was for dine-in, and the third was a dance hall and later an arcade. The Half Moon also serves European-style wieners manufactured by Winnipeg Old Country Sausage. One of the most popular items is the Moon Dog, consisting of cheese, bacon, fried onions, pickles and mustard, and the Half Moon serves about 2000 on an average summer weekend day.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Hot_dogs_outside_North_America\">Hot dogs outside North America</span></h2>\n\n<p>In most of the world, \"hot dog\" is recognized as a sausage in a bun, but the type varies considerably. The name is applied to something that would not be described as a hot dog in North America. For example, in New Zealand, it refers to a battered sausage, often on a stick (which is known as a corn dog in North America), and the version in a bun is called an \"American hot dog\".</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional center\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 183px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 183px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 183px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 183px\">\n\n</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Records\">Records</span></h2>\n\n<p>The world's longest hot dog created was 60 meters (197 ft), which rested within a 60.3-meter (198 ft) bun. The hot dog was prepared by Shizuoka Meat Producers for the All-Japan Bread Association, which baked the bun and coordinated the event, including official measurement for the world record. The hot dog and bun were the center of a media event in celebration of the Association's 50th anniversary on August 4, 2006, at the Akasaka Prince Hotel, Tokyo, Japan.</p>\n<p>A hot dog prepared by head chef Joe Calderone in Manhattan sold for US$69 during the National Hot Dog Day in 2010, making it the most expensive hot dog sold at the time. The hot dog was topped with truffle oil, duck foie gras, and truffle butter.</p>\n\n<p>On May 31, 2012, Guinness World Records certified the world record for most expensive hot dog at $145.49. The \"California Capitol City Dawg\", served at Capitol Dawg in Sacramento, California, features a grilled 460 mm (18 in) all-beef in natural casing frank from Chicago, served on a fresh baked herb and oil focaccia roll, spread with white truffle butter, then grilled. The record breaking hot dog is topped with a whole grain mustard from France, garlic &amp; herb mayonnaise, sauteed chopped shallots, organic mixed baby greens, maple syrup marinated/fruitwood smoked uncured bacon from New Hampshire, chopped tomato, expensive moose cheese from Sweden, sweetened dried cranberries, basil olive oil/pear-cranberry-coconut balsamic vinaigrette, and ground peppercorn. Proceeds from the sale of each 1.4 kg (3 lb) super dog are donated to the Shriners Hospitals for Children.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Home page for a PBS documentary about hot dogs</li>\n<li>USDA Fact Sheet on hot dogs</li>\n</ul>"
