      "description": "<p>A <b>baozi</b> (Chinese: <span lang=\"zh\" xml:lang=\"zh\"><span><span><span> </span>包子</span></span></span>) or simply known as <b>bao</b>, <b>bau</b>, <b>humbow</b>, <b>nunu</b>, <b>bakpao</b> (Hokkien), <b>bausak</b>, <b>pow</b>, <b>pau</b> or <b>pao</b> (Hakka) is a type of steamed, filled, bun or bread-like (i.e. made with yeast) item in various Chinese cuisines, as there is much variation as to the fillings and the preparations. In its bun-like aspect it is very similar to the traditional Chinese mantou. It can be filled with meat and/or vegetarian fillings. In Japanese, the dish is known as \"<i>paozu</i>\".</p>\n<p>Two types are found in most parts of China and Indonesia: <i>Dàbāo</i> (大包, \"big bun\"), measuring about 10 cm across, served individually, and usually purchased for take-away. The other type, <i>Xiǎobāo</i> (小包, \"small bun\"), measure approximately 5 cm wide, and are most commonly eaten in restaurants, but may also be purchased for take-away. Each order consists of a steamer containing between three and ten pieces. A small ceramic dish is provided for vinegar or soy sauce, both of which are available in bottles at the table, along with chili and garlic paste.</p>\n<p></p>\n",
